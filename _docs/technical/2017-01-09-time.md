# Time in Cardano SL

Proper work with time is very important for *Ouroboros* protocol. This guide
describes how nodes work with time and synchrony.

## Model

As mentioned [earlier](/technical/#high-level-overview), from *Ouroboros'* point
of view time is divided into *epochs* and every epoch is divided into *slots*.
Obviously, all nodes have to work with epochs and slots synchronously: each node
have to know when previous slot ends and when the next one begins. The problem
is that all nodes work worldwide, on different computers with different local
time settings. So nodes need the way how to obtain real current time with enough
precision and synchrony. In this case each node will know what slot is current
one and slot-leaders will be able to produce new blocks in their time.

## NTP Workflow

Nodes use NTP-servers for synchronization, read [What is
NTP?](http://www.ntp.org/ntpfaq/NTP-s-def.htm) for more details. So, this is a
core idea of NTP-client and NTP-server communication:

       NTP-client                     NTP-server

    +---------------+              +---------------+
    |               |              |               |
    |      sent REQ ---> A    X ---> received REQ  |
    |               |              |               |
    | received RESP <--- B    Y <--- sent RESP     |
    |               |              |               |
    +---------------+              +---------------+

where:

1.  `REQ` - time request (NTP message).
2.  `RESP` - time response (NTP Data Packet).
3.  `A` - timestamp when the client actually sent `REQ` to the server.
4.  `X` - timestamp when the server actually received `REQ` from the client.
5.  `Y` - timestamp when the server actually sent `RESP` to the client.
6.  `B` - timestamp when the client actually received `RESP` from the server.

Timestamp consists of seconds (32 bit) and second fractions (32 bit), since date
**01.01.1900**. For example, date "1 January 2000: corresponds to seconds value
`3155673600`. Second fraction value can be different, up to minimal possible
value 232 picoseconds.

Please note that timestamps `A` and `B` are "wrong" because the time is obtained
from the client's machine, so these timestamps cannot be trusted by default.
Timestamps `X` and `Y` are "true" because the time is obtained from the server,
so they can be trusted by default.

We can imagine it on a time scale with these example values (in seconds):

    ----*-------*-------------*-------*---->
        A       X             Y       B
        100     150           160     120

It's assumed that network delays are equal (i.e time for transmitting `REQ` from
the client to the server and time for transmitting `RESP` from the server to the
client are the same). So from the client's point of view total transmit time is
`B` - `A`, e.g. 120 - 100 = 20 seconds. `RESP` contains `X` and `Y`, so client
can calculate server's delay as `Y` - `X`, e.g. 160 - 150 = 10 seconds, let's
call it `D`. 20 - `D` = 10 seconds, it's total network delay, 10 / 2 = 5
seconds, it's amount of time it took the response to get from the server to the
client, let's call it `R`.

Then NTP-client adds `R` to the `Y` to estimate that it received the response at
"true" time 165 seconds, let's call it `T`. So `T` - `B`, e.g. 165 - 120 = +45
seconds, let's call it `C`, it's a correction NTP-client has to make with it's
local time.

## Cardano SL Time Concepts

There're fundamental time concepts we use in our implementation:

1.  **global time** â€” the time obtained from NTP server. We can think of it as
    of "true" time, because it can be trusted by default.
2.  **local time** - [current time](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/c3146f15f2f603c746c89d0f24578a219b982823/infra/Pos/Slotting/Impl/Ntp.hs#L105)
    obtained from the node. We can think of it as of "wrong" time, because the
    local time taken from the node is not always valid (for example, it may be
    changed manually).
3.  **margin** - difference, in microseconds, between global time and local time
    which we got from NTP server last time. In example above it's `C` value.
4.  **real time** - [sum of transmit time and last margin](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/c3146f15f2f603c746c89d0f24578a219b982823/infra/Pos/Slotting/Impl/Ntp.hs#L273),
    where transmit time is a time when the node sent request to NTP server (in
    example above it's `A` value).

## Slotting Workflow

Each node periodically polls [predefined
set](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/c3146f15f2f603c746c89d0f24578a219b982823/infra/Pos/Slotting/Impl/Ntp.hs#L282)
of NTP servers, and configuration files define this period as NTP poll delay
(for example, this is [production-related
delay](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/d01d392d49db8a25e17749173ec9bce057911191/core/constants.yaml#L107)).
As mentioned in example above, we assume that some network timeout between
sending `REQ` to NTP server and receiving `RESP`. This timeout is also defined
in configuration files (again, this is [production-related
timeout](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/d01d392d49db8a25e17749173ec9bce057911191/core/constants.yaml#L106)),
and NTP client [uses this timeout as a
lag](https://github.com/serokell/time-warp-nt/blob/8093761c30956eb5088a70da0ef971abd42ea842/src/NTP/Client.hs#L178).
Our NTP client is [defined at network
layer](https://github.com/serokell/time-warp-nt/blob/8093761c30956eb5088a70da0ef971abd42ea842/src/NTP/Client.hs#L289).

After slotting started polling begins ([sending
queries](https://github.com/serokell/time-warp-nt/blob/8093761c30956eb5088a70da0ef971abd42ea842/src/NTP/Client.hs#L168)
and [receiving
responses](https://github.com/serokell/time-warp-nt/blob/8093761c30956eb5088a70da0ef971abd42ea842/src/NTP/Client.hs#L244)
are starts). NTP client formes [NTP
packet](https://github.com/serokell/time-warp-nt/blob/8093761c30956eb5088a70da0ef971abd42ea842/src/NTP/Client.hs#L153)
and [sends
query](https://github.com/serokell/time-warp-nt/blob/8093761c30956eb5088a70da0ef971abd42ea842/src/NTP/Client.hs#L154).
Then it waiting for
[responses](https://github.com/serokell/time-warp-nt/blob/8093761c30956eb5088a70da0ef971abd42ea842/src/NTP/Client.hs#L181)
from available NTP servers, after that it [picks mean margin
value](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/c3146f15f2f603c746c89d0f24578a219b982823/infra/Pos/Slotting/Impl/Ntp.hs#L295).

Then the node
[handles](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/c3146f15f2f603c746c89d0f24578a219b982823/infra/Pos/Slotting/Impl/Ntp.hs#L268)
obtained mean value. Transmit time (`A` value from example) and mean margin (`C`
value from example) are summed and gives a real time of sending `REQ`. This
[real
time](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/c3146f15f2f603c746c89d0f24578a219b982823/infra/Pos/Slotting/Impl/Ntp.hs#L273)
is storing as a last (corrected) local time. This last local time [will be
used](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/c3146f15f2f603c746c89d0f24578a219b982823/infra/Pos/Slotting/Impl/Ntp.hs#L218)
for obtaining of current slot.

When the node again [checks current
time](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/c3146f15f2f603c746c89d0f24578a219b982823/infra/Pos/Slotting/Impl/Ntp.hs#L217),
it uses the last margin
[stored](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/c3146f15f2f603c746c89d0f24578a219b982823/infra/Pos/Slotting/Impl/Ntp.hs#L274)
at previous poll. Now we have the sum of these timestamps, it's corrected
current time, and the node has to check is it possible to trust this time or
not. We can trust the current (corrected) time if it is:

1.  not bigger than sum of the last stored local time, NTP delay and max error
    value (for safety);
2.  and not less than difference between the last stored local time and max
    error value.

The actual value of max error is [defined in configuration file](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/f374a970dadef0fe62cf69e8b9a6b8cc606b5c7d/core/constants.yaml#L71).

If it's trusted time - node definitely knows which slot is [the current
one](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/c3146f15f2f603c746c89d0f24578a219b982823/infra/Pos/Slotting/Impl/Ntp.hs#L176),
so if this node is a slot leader - it can check if the current slot is "belongs
to me".

If we can't trust this time - we can't get an [id of the current
slot](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/c3146f15f2f603c746c89d0f24578a219b982823/infra/Pos/Slotting/Impl/Ntp.hs#L192).

Third condition is an [outdated slotting
data](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/c3146f15f2f603c746c89d0f24578a219b982823/infra/Pos/Slotting/Impl/Ntp.hs#L173).
In means that node doesn't know recent slotting data, so in this case
[index](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/d01d392d49db8a25e17749173ec9bce057911191/infra/Pos/Slotting/Types.hs#L32)
of the last known penult epoch [is
attached](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/c3146f15f2f603c746c89d0f24578a219b982823/infra/Pos/Slotting/Impl/Ntp.hs#L225)
to result.
